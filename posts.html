    It began when I started thinking about transforming the lab, where I was working back then,
    into the successful business that would allow me to retire before my 30s. At the time, I was
    working on my MSc Thesis and working on the FIDEOS project (Tala+2014). In the lab next to
    the optics lab, my colleague Samuel Ropert was working on the electronics for the same instrument.
    It was in one of those talks (the ones full of non-working-instrument frustration), when we
    came up with the idea of starting our own company. It was our time to bring the astronomy
    technology to the Chilean industry. We saw it all, on the front page of the newspapers it would
    be written, “Young Chilean entrepreneurs re-define the destiny of the industry of astronomy with
    their innovative creations”. And with this would come a good life with no worries, drinking pisco
    sour in my own observatory, in the heart of the Chilean Andes, staring at the sunset inside a warm jacuzzi.
