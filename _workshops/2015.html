  After collecting everyone on Saturday afternoon we assembled at Santiago's
  house for an amazing pizza and brownie dinner. Sunday we got up early to take
  the funicular to the castle gardens and Königstuhl. We took the train to
  Neckargemünd exploring the town and sitting on the riverbank feeding the
  swans. Dinner was at Vetter's, where we met Isabelle who's four weeks from
  having her baby!

  On Monday we toured the MPIA, and massive thanks to everyone who showed us
  around. In the afternoon Roland gave us a very warm introduction to out
  talks. It always amazed me to hear what everyone is up to - some great
  progress on everything since last year! Thanks to Thomas for dropping in to
  say hello to everyone and listen to some of the talks. For me the best bit
  was the closing debate, where we found out about exciting possibilities
  within instrumentation. Again massive thanks to the MPIA for our free lunch
  and coffee.
