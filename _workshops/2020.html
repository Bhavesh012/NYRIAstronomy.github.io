The Network for Young Researchers in Instrumentation for Astrophysics (NYRIA) is organising its 
	4th annual workshop from <b>26th - 30th October 2020</b>. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have decided to go <b>virtual</b>. 	
	
NYRIA is an organisation founded and run by PhD students and post-doctoral researchers with 
	the goal to create a network amongst early career researchers working in VIS/IR ground 
	based astronomical instrumentation. Each year NYRIA organises a workshop, always at a different 
	institute involved in instrumentation, to create a space to present the work of the attendants, 
	to hold open discussions and to encourage collaborations between participants and institutes. 
	Please see our <a href="/../workshops" target="_blank">workshops page</a> for more information on our previous events. 
</p>   
  
<p>  
The workshop is aimed for early career researchers, i.e. final year Bachelor students, Masters students, 
	PhD students and post-doctoral researchers, working in <b>ground based, visible and infrared instrumentation 
	for astronomy</b>. Please see our <a href="/../members" target="_blank">members page</a> to see the different 
	research areas they are currently involved in.
</p>  

<p>
Since this workshop will be virtual the template of the meeting will be different to previous years. 
	The workshop will last 3.5 hours (including a 30 minute break) a day for 5 days, in order 
	(i) to include as many time zones as possible and (ii) we felt this was optimum time for virtual 
	engagement. The workshop will include talks by participants and small group activities including 
	virtual lab and/or instrument tours, technical challenges, intimate discussions with experts in 
	instrumentation, as well as virtual coffee break rooms.
