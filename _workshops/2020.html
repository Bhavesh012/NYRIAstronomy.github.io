The Network for Young Researchers in Instrumentation for Astrophysics (NYRIA) is organising its sixth annual workshop 
	from <b>26th - 30th October 2020</b>. However, this year things will be a little different. Due to the COVID-19 we have
  decided to postpone our planned workshop at ESO Garching, Germany and this year go virtual. 
  
	NYRIA is an organisation founded and run by PhD students and post-doctoral researchers with the goal to create a 
	network amongst early career researchers in VIS/IR ground based astronomical instrumentation. Each year NYRIA 
	organises a meeting, always at a different institute, to create a space to present the work of the attendants, 
	to hold open discussions and to encourage collaborations between participants and institutes. Please see our 
	<a href="/../workshops" target="_blank">workshops page</a> for more information on our previous events. 
</p>   
  
<p>  
 The workshop is aimed for early career researchers, i.e. final year Bachelor students, Masters students, PhD 
	students and post-doctoral researchers, working in <b>ground based, visible and infrared instrumentation for 
	astronomy</b>. Please see our <a href="/../members" target="_blank">members page</a> to see the different 
	research areas they are currently involved in.
</p>  

<p>
 Since this workshop will be virtual the template of the meeting will be different to previous years. The workshop 
  will last 3.5 hours a day for 5 days, in order (i) to try an include as many time zones as possible and (ii) we felt
  this was optimum time for virtual engagement. The workshop will include talks by participants and small group activites 
  including virtual lab/instrument tours/hackthons 
  
  The workshop will include a series of talks by all participants and guest speakers, tours of the optics labs at the 
	faculty and some sightseeing. Breakfast, lunches, coffee and excursions will be provided for all, with 
	accommodation provided for applicants outside of Lisbon. We do however ask for a registration fee of â‚¬60 which 
	will go towards the workshop dinner and the social event.
