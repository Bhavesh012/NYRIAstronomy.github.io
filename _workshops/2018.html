The goal for NYRIA2018 in Leiden was to connect young researchers in instrumentation and to stimulate 
  interaction and collaboration between participants. As well as to, show this 
  talented group of researchers what Leiden University and the Netherlands in general has to offer. 
  The workshop had 38 participants from 22 different institutes and 10 different countries spanning four continents.

On Monday, overseas attendees gathered at the hotel where the local organising committee escorted them, by bike, to Leiden 
  University. The workshop was kicked off with an introduction on Dutch astronomy, including the Netherlands Research School 
  for Astronomy (NOVA) and Leiden Observatory. Afterwards each participant gave an elevator pitch on their research. This was 
  meant as a short personal introduction. We thought it was important to let all participants give a short introduction at the beginning of 
  the workshop. This would let people know of each others work before their main presentation. This was especially helpful 
  for the participants who gave a presentation at the end of the week, as they could then already start talking with people 
  at the start of the workshop. We concluded the first day with a borrel and pizza dinner. The participants really enjoyed 
  the borrel and the pizza and felt that it was a good way to connect with other people in a more relaxed environment.

  The first day was a great success where the participants could get to know each other. This was noticeable during Tuesday 
  morning where a majority of the people already started to discuss their research. We started the day with two rounds of 
  presentations from the participants of the workshop with a coffee break in between the two rounds. The presentations were 
  of high quality and very interesting as some people were immediately discussing ideas and collaborations during the coffee 
  break and lunch. After lunch we had two invited talks from staff members in astronomical instrumentation from 
  Leiden Observatory. The invited talks were a mix of a talk and a question- and-answers session, focused on how to build a 
  career in astronomical instrumentation. This was an important topic for us, as the NYRIA workshop was focused on connecting 
  and networking for the new generation of astronomical instrumentalists. We noticed that this was very well received by the 
  participants as they were very involved in the Q&A sessions. In the end we went over the scheduled time due to the amount
  of questions. The day was concluded with a typical Dutch dinner at the Schaapsbel where all the international participants
  were able to try dutch pancakes.

  The Wednesday morning was filled with presentations by the participants. The afternoon was reserved for a hackthon. 
  The goal of this event was to brainstorm about new telescope concepts for the next generation of telescopes. This is 
  relevant as current technology is not sufficient to build telescopes larger than 40 meters, which is the size of the 
  telescopes currently in construction. To kick off the hackathon Prof. dr. Christoph Keller gave a presentation on how to
  become a creative scientist and an introduction of the subject. We formed groups of approximately ten persons, each 
  supervised by one of the organisers of the workshop. Each group came up with unique and innovative solutions, which ranged 
  from large fiber bundles to interferometers in space, that were presented at the end of the afternoon. The day concluded 
  with a dinner at Proeflokaal Bregje, where in an informal setting more socialisation could take place.

<p>
On Thursday we started with the last round of talks by the participants. After the lunch we went to ESA/ESTEC with a rental 
  bus. The goal of the ESA/ESTEC visit was to showcase Dutch space- instrumentation efforts. Therefore we had a non-standard 
  talk and tour by the lead optical engineer at ESTEC in combination with a standard ESA introduction. Both were received very 
  well by the participants.

<p>
The Friday started with a presentation by Prof. dr. Tim de Zeeuw on the realization of large astronomical research
  facilities. As being the former Director-General of the European Southern Observatory Prof. de Zeeuw could show his 
  unique hands-on experience on this subject. The many questions at the end of presentation demonstrated the high engagement 
  by the participants. The week concluded with a short summary of the workshop and an outlook to future workshops and the 
  organisation of NYRIA in general.
