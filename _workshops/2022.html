<p> 
After two years of pandemic, and virtual workshops, it is our pleasure to announce our in-person NYRIA Workshop 2022!
  Our 6th annual workshop will be co-organized and hosted by <b>Officina Stellare</b> from <b>November 7 to 11, 2022</b>, in Sarcedo, Italy.
Officina Stellare is a leader in the design, development and delivery of complex opto-mechanical systems and instrumentation for both Ground and Space-based applications.
The workshop is designed to encourage early career researchers (i.e. final year Bachelor students to post-doctoral researchers), working in ground-based, 
	visible and infrared instrumentation for astronomy to engage with each other in a friendly environment. The workshop will include talks by participants, 
	a poster session, and small group activities including career talks with experts in instrumentation, lab and/or instrument tours, and technical challenges (hackathon). <br>
	
This is the first announcement of the workshop. More details about the registration, and the detailed schedule will follow. 
We will be sending out more announcement using the official workshop’s email: nyria2022workshop@gmail.com
