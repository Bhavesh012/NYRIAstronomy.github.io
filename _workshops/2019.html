<p>	The NYRIA 2019 workshop was held in Lisbon – Portugal. The goal of the workshop was to gather a group of young researchers working 
	in astronomical instrumentation to share their ideas, thoughts, and work in a friendly environment. As every year, the NYRIA 
	workshop is held in a different location, trying to gather a mix of current members and and new ones to wider the network. After a 
	welcome talk on Monday to introduce the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences and the University of Lisbon, we kicked 
	the workshop by an invited talk by Gerardo Avila, an expert on ESO's instruments. At the end of the first day, the participants 
	had the opportunity to introduce themselves in a one-minute pop-up talk. </p>

<p> On Tuesday, the scheduled was condensed with interesting talks of the participants covering the main topic of the workshop: ground 
	based astronomical instrumentation. We finished the day by an invited talk by Nuno Santos, one of the experts in exoplanets and 
	in particular the science requirements behind the design of high-resolution astronomical instruments. </p>

<p> The third day of the workshop was also an interestingly condensed day. Along with the participants talk, we had two invited speakers: 
	Alexandre Cabral talking about all the design and commissioning phases of an instrument from an instrumental point view; and 
	João Retrê discussing the importance of science communication and outreach. We have to stress that the activities prepared by 
	João were more like hands-on and it helped the participants engaging more together. At the end of the day, we launched the projects 
	of the next day. </p>


	
<p> On Thursday, it was a scratch your head day. The participants were randomly divided into groups and each one was assigned a mission. 
	The mission was to design an instrument to be used for undergraduate/graduate students to test a concept or confirm any idea they 
	might have. At the end of the day, all the groups presented their work. The majority of the ideas were quite impressive, even with 
	a low budget. Once in Portugal, you have to try their traditional food: cod fish, or as they call it in Portuguese bachalhau. The 
	night of Thursday was the social event and dinner. Before heading to the restaurant, the participants had the chance to visit the 
	ocenarium of Lisbon, one of the biggest in the world. At the end of the night, all the participants, and the invited speakers were 
	invited to enjoy a meal and couple of drinks at a restaurant near the seaside. </p>

<p> Last but not least. The last day of the workshop started by a discussion regarding gender balance and diversity in astronomy, 
	and in particular in the field of astronomical instrumentation. This invited talk was led by Gabriella Gilli and Vardan Adibekyan. 
	Trust me, it was intense. After the talk it was the closing ceremony, where each participant was handed a certificate of attendance 
	after discussing the pros and cons of the workshop to better organize a 2020 one. At the end, we all cheered together with some 
	traditional drinks, in particular porto wine and ginga. Not to forget the cheese as well. </p>


	<p> Cheers to an awesome workshop!	</p>
