<h3>Acknowledgements:</h3>
<p>We would like to warmly thanks our two funding parts, ASHRA and CIAS. In particular, David Mouillet for his trust in our project and Gérard Rousset and Yann Clénet for hosting us at LESIA. Thanks to Nicole Letourneur from CIAS, we benefited from amazing coffee breaks in the beautiful Urania room, which really helped creating nice interactions within the group. We also would like to thanks the Observatoire de Paris and Nicolas Lesté-Lasserre for providing us full access to the Observatoire de Paris for the historical visit of the site.
We of course would like to thanks the speakers for sharing their time with us and for fruitful discussions: Pierre Léna, Guy Perrin, Pierre Baudoz and all the researchers from the LESIA who took their time to make us visit their optical labs.
