<p> 
It is our pleasure to announce that registrations are now open for NYRIA Virtual Workshop 2021! <br>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to once again go virtual and our 5th annual workshop will take place from 21st - 29th October 2021.
The workshop is designed to encourage early career researchers (i.e. final year Bachelor students to post-doctoral researchers), 
	working in ground-based, visible and infrared instrumentation for astronomy to engage with each other in a 
	friendly environment. The workshop will last ~ <b>3.5 hours a day</b>, for <b>2+5 days</b>. The workshop will include talks by participants, 
	a poster session, inclusion/diversity session, and small group activities including career talks with experts in instrumentation, 
	virtual lab or instrument tours, technical challenges (hackathon), as well as a 30-minute virtual coffee break. At the end of 
	every day of the workshop, the participants are invited (not mandatory) to join a virtual platform for beer/coffee for social interactions. <br>
