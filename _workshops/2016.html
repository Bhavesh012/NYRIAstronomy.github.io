  Following the SPIE conference in Edinburgh attendees of the Durham meeting
  arrived in Durham on the Sunday before the meeting. They were accommodated at
  Collingwood College and visited the main sites of Durham city.
</p>

<p>
  On Monday morning the attendees were taken, by mini bus, to the CfAI NETPark
  Facility in Sedgefield, approximately 30 minutes outside the city.  We were
  greeted by Dr Stephen Rolt and Dr Cyril Bourgenot who gave us a tour of the
  facilities.

  Following the tour we had lunch at the NETPark canteen and went back to
  Collingwood College where we continued the meeting with an afternoon of talks.
  These talks were open to all of the CfAI students and staff.
</p>

<p>
  On Tuesday we continued the event with a tour of the astronomical
  instrumentation labs in the Rochester Building, Department of Physics. Dr
  Andrew Reeves showed the DRAGON test bench and explained its operation.
  Following the tour and a quick break we continued with the rest of the talks.

<p>
  We would like to say a big thank you to CfAI, namely Prof. Richard Myers, for
  being so encouraging of this meeting and for funding the event, which
  included accommodation, lunch and coffee as well as travel to NETPark. We
  would also like to thank Dr Stephen Rolt, Dr Cyril Bourgenot and Dr Andrew
  Reeves for showing as around the CfAI facilities and Claire Whitehill who
  organised much of the event, this would not have been possible without her.
