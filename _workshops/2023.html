  The 8th edition of the NYRIA workshop was successfully held from 13th to 17th November at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM). NYRIA, which stands for Network for Young Researchers in Instrumentation for Astrophysics, aims to foster discussions and collaborations among early career researchers in the field. This year's event was notably hosted in Marseille, a significant centre for research and development in instrumentation.

  The week-long workshop featured presentations from each participant. A highlight was the opportunity to visit LAM's facilities and engage with experts discussing the instruments developed in the laboratory. This year's hackathon focused on brainstorming innovative methods to represent astronomical data, supported by the Fablab adjacent to LAM. Besides instrumentation, an insightful presentation addressed Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) in the field, exploring potential improvements.
<p>  
  The workshop culminated in an open panel discussion about future directions in instrumentation, particularly post-Giant telescopes era. This session provided valuable insights into the next generation of astronomical instruments.
<p>   
  Special thanks are extended to the exceptional administrative team - Florence Roman, Solange, and Christine - whose dedicated efforts were instrumental in the smooth running of the workshop. Their contribution was invaluable in facilitating a successful and memorable event.

  The upcoming edition of the workshop is tentatively scheduled to take place in California next year. If you are interested in joining our network and being a part of this exciting event, please feel free to reach out to us!
