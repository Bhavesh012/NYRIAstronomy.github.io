  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>
    In 2014 the University of Heidelberg and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
    (MPIA) together with the Santander Bank organised a summer school, "<i>Reaching
    the limits of the sky, astronomical instrumentation in the 21st Century</i>".
  </p>
  <p>
    This summer school addressed recent developments in adaptive optics and
    interferometry with an emphasis on VLTI and E-ELT instrumentation.  Over the
    course of two weeks, eighteen students from Europe and Latin America gathered
    in Santiago, Chile, to learn from experts, socialise and learn about other
    areas of instrumentation from each other. In addition they were given a guided
    tour of the ESO facilities at Paranal observatory.

    In 2015, half of the students met in Heidelberg to give talks, socialise and
    visit the facilities at MPIA and the Landessternewarte, Heidelberg, Germany.
    Following this first unofficial meeting, the idea grew to start a yearly
    gathering for instrumentation graduates and early postgraduates to network,
    visit institutes involved in instrumentation for astrophysics and learn about
    other fields within astronomical instrumentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We therefore built <b>NYRIA</b> for <i>Network of Young Researchers in
    Instrumentation for Astrophysics</i>. This network focuses on ground-based
    instrumentation in the visible-infrared domain.

    The next generation of telescopes and instruments will be built by large
    international consortia. Therefore, it is essential that the next generation of
    astronomical instrumentalists get to know each other in preparation for working
    in these groups. To this end we aim to make these meetings annual and hope that
    the network of early career researchers grow and strengthen. This will allow us
    to update our research and findings, exchange ideas and discuss recent
    developments in everyoneâ€™s field. The topics will span from hardware and
    software, to topics as diverse as wavefront sensing, coronagraphy,
    spectroscopy, fiber optics, and post-processing techniques to reach the limit
    of current and future instruments.
