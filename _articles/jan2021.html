<p style="text-align:center; font-size:34px"><b>Musings on student supervision</b></p>

At the NYRIA meeting in Leiden in 2018, I had the ‘brilliant’ idea to give a talk on student-supervisor relations. 
Now, this is a complex topic, which I’m really not qualified to speak about, particularly as I’ve had no formal 
training, but as a new supervisor I really wanted to discuss it with other people.  It turned out to be a brilliant 
idea; if you want to learn about how to supervise people, ask the people who are being supervised about their relationship
with their supervisor and how it could be improved. For the rest that follows here, these are my opinions, formed 
from my supervision experience, from presenting that talk and chatting to the attendees at the meeting. If you want a more
solid scientific basis, a really nice place to start is (see footnote). The main message I got from it is the supervisor 
student relationship can seriously influence a PhD. <br><br>

The relationship between student and supervisor is complex and if you’re not in the mood for something serious, there are 
many excellent comics and descriptions of the student – supervisor relationship, like the one below. <br><br>

Admittedly this is from the side of the professor, and sometimes, however wrong it may be, this can be very true. 
However it's also important to note that a similar process happens the other way around and it is important for the 
student to see their supervisor as a human, instead of a fountain of all knowledge and an assistant.<br><br>

As I mentioned at the start, in the last couple of years I’ve begun supervising PhD students and now have a mini group 
of two in Germany, one who I supervise remotely in Durham and plus a couple of Hiwis (German students who get paid to 
do mini projects). This means a lot of learning for me; perhaps unsurprisingly, it turns out everybody works and responds differently.<br><br>
