At the NYRIA meeting in Leiden in 2018, I had the ‘brilliant’ idea to give a talk on student-supervisor relations. 
Now, this is a complex topic, which I’m really not qualified to speak about, particularly as I’ve had no formal 
training, but as a new supervisor I really wanted to discuss it with other people.  It turned out to be a brilliant 
idea; if you want to learn about how to supervise people, ask the people who are being supervised about their relationship
with their supervisor and how it could be improved. For the rest that follows here, these are my opinions, formed 
from my supervision experience, from presenting that talk and chatting to the attendees at the meeting. If you want a more
solid scientific basis, a really nice place to start is (see footnote). The main message I got from it is the supervisor 
student relationship can seriously influence a PhD. <br><br>

The relationship between student and supervisor is complex and if you’re not in the mood for something serious, there are 
many excellent comics and descriptions of the student – supervisor relationship, like the one below. <br><br>

Admittedly this is from the side of the professor, and sometimes, however wrong it may be, this can be very true. 
However it's also important to note that a similar process happens the other way around and it is important for the 
student to see their supervisor as a human, instead of a fountain of all knowledge and an assistant.<br><br>

As I mentioned at the start, in the last couple of years I’ve begun supervising PhD students and now have a mini group 
of two in Germany, one who I supervise remotely in Durham and plus a couple of Hiwis (German students who get paid to 
do mini projects). This means a lot of learning for me; perhaps unsurprisingly, it turns out everybody works and responds differently.<br><br>


 
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:24px"><b>Things we wished supervisees would know about supervisors?</b></p>

Let’s start with me, what to know about me as a new supervisor. Firstly, I don’t know everything. Actually, I’m not 
even close, though maybe when I get that Professor title this will change. That doesn’t mean I’m useless however, 
whilst I probably know more about the field than you, by the time you’re a couple of years into your project you’ll 
know more than me, at least in a specific area. <br><br>

This happening for the first time is actually quite difficult for both the student (let’s deal with that later) and 
also the supervisor. Suddenly, someone they are supposed to be teaching is telling them that they’re wrong. A good 
example of this is a three day debate I recently lost with my student. We were both very convinced we were right and
arguing passionately about it. Eventually, it turned out he was right. Believe me, as a supervisor this is a strange
feeling and was a little kick to my ego. One of the best things I learnt from it was how important it is to remain
civil during these debates, no matter how much you think you are (and may in fact be) correct. Students, please
remember your supervisors are human and not fountains of all knowledge, they are wrong more often than you think.<br><br>

However, when you are presented with a situation where  you know more than them, try to still listen to their ideas. 
They might not always be right, but their experience often means they’ve got some very good ideas to listen to. A long 
time ago as a student I was convinced that I knew more than a postdoc who was telling me how to solve a problem. Had I 
listened, I would probably have saved myself a couple of months of work. So listen, even if you discount their ideas later.<br><br>


<p style="text-align:center; font-size:24px"><b>Things supervisors should know about their students</b></p>

Now things I’ve learnt about my students. Firstly, and this always sounds stupid, but everyone is an individual; what 
works with one student won’t work with another. Some people like open ended projects and will hate doing an assigned 
project, while some like to be given a task to accomplish, if they are given an open ended project they sit around unsure
of what to do . So far, out of my students I’ve had a complete mix and found life can be unproductive on both sides if 
you get it wrong. Try to understand your student and work around their needs. One way to do this is to ask their opinion,
but remember, they are still figuring this out, you’re unlikely to get it 100% right. If you can do this, you’ll find both
of your lives are far more productive and you’ll reduce the potential for friction.<br><br>

Try to understand your student and work around their needs. One way to do this is to ask their opinion, but remember, 
they are still figuring this out.  If you can do this, you’ll find both of your lives are far more productive and you’ll 
reduce the potential for friction. Just note you’re unlikely to get it 100% right, but try to foster open and good communication
and be a little flexible. <br><br>

Secondly, inclusivity is important. People come from different backgrounds, and have different ways of interacting  and 
socialising. I personally like to chat about ideas in the pub, the first drink is serious work chat, the second becomes 
more personal and by the third the ‘creative’ ideas are flowing. This has allowed me to come up with some of my best projects,
because of the relaxed nature of the interaction. However, this may be an uncomfortable place for some people. Maybe someone
doesn’t drink alcohol or can’t come after work due to personal/family commitments. If this is the case, you lose the thing that 
made the interaction so good in the first place.  Be aware of this, since ignoring these factors can end up doing the exact opposite 
of what you set out to achieve. You may need to adjust your behaviour, depending on the group. Make sure you check as it can cause
friction and people feeling excluded.<br><br>

Thirdly, students can really benefit from positive (and if need be negative) feedback. As a student, if ignored, I could disappear
down rabbit holes for weeks. Having someone there to help push me in the right direction really improved both my motivation and
productivity. Try to set aside time to give your students feedback, noting if there is room for improvement but also giving positive
feedback. These student years build the foundation of their academic career. Supporting the development of their skills and work habits
will not only increase the productivity of your group but will also help them in their future endeavours. <br><br>


<p style="text-align:center; font-size:24px"><b>General Thoughts</b></p>

So, onto general comments to both sides. At the NYRIA 2018 workshop in Leiden I asked how often people saw their supervisor. 
The optimum seemed to be approximately once a week, though this varied wildly depending on the person. Almost everybody felt 
that things were ok, or could be slightly improved; very few thought the timing and length of their supervisor sessions were perfect. 
Overall, I would suggest aiming for once a week, this means if you miss one meeting, or meet twice in one week it’s not the end of the 
world. The supervisor still has time for their own work and the student doesn’t feel overly pressured or ignored. <br><br>

Finally, all I’ve said here is from my personal experience, so please take what I’ve said with a pinch of salt (and read the professional
articles). Remember the grass is always greener on the other side and nothing is perfect, normally ‘pretty good’ is actually great.
