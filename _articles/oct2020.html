<h1>From A Crazy Idea To The Skies</h1>

<p> There are those moments, when the walls come down, the formalities disappear and you are just 
chatting to an old colleague or a new acquaintance in the field, and ideas take on a life of 
their own. Crazy and fun ideas are “seriously” discussed. The potential problems and possible
solutions incite debates and excitement. But how do you start a collaboration? How do you get 
funding? Is the idea worth investing resources into? These are but a few questions you might ask yourself. <br><br>
  
On the 19th of March, in the midst of the corona-virus lockdown, I sat with Sebastiaan Haffert and 
Robert Harris over Zoom to talk about their collaboration. The design, development and deployment of 
the Multi Core Integral Field Unit. A collection of ideas that took three years to condense into a 
research project. The MCIFU (pronounced em-chifu) is a prototype of a spectrograph that will be used 
to characterize exoplanets. <br><br>

The project has benefited from over 30 co-authors, with a now transnational group including contributions 
  from the UK, Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands and the USA. <br><br></p>


<h2>Back Story</h2>
  
<p>Rob and Sebastiaan (two co-founders of NYRIA) met back in 2014 at the "Reaching the limits of the sky, 
  astronomical instrumentation in the 21st Century" in Chile. It was off the back of this summer 
  school that NYRIA was formed. At the time, Rob was a final year PhD student at Durham University, 
  UK and Sebastiaan was a Masters Student at Leiden University, Netherlands. Since then Rob went on to 
  finish his PhD and is now a post-doc at the MPIA, Germany working on the MICADO instrument for the ELT. 
  Sebastiaan finished his Masters Degree and PhD at Leiden University and took his Sagan fellowship to 
  Steward Observatory, USA to work on the exoplanet imaging instrument MagAO-X. </p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<b>Can you in a few lines describe the project that the two of you are collaborating on?</b> <br>
<b>Seb:</b> “We are collaborating on a small spectrograph”. <br>
<b>Rob:</b> “To characterise exoplanets”   *rob grins in his characteristically rob grin way* <br>
<b>Seb:</b> “Yeah [...] what is novel about our new approach is that we use a lot of new photonic 
  technology developed and collaborated from Rob’s side to create a new link between the 
  image plane and the spectrograph [...] for this kind of science you need to have some 
  way to transport the focal plane image to the spectrograph and we developed a new photonic 
  way of doing it by using a special fibre and 3D printed lenses, laser written waveguides, 
  fancy new stuff [...] It’s a novel spectrograph with a novel way of reformatting the 
  image plane into a spectrograph. <br>
