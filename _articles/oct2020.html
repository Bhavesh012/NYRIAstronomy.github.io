<h1>From A Crazy Idea To The Skies</h1>

<p> There are those moments, when the walls come down, the formalities disappear and you are just 
chatting to an old colleague or a new acquaintance in the field, and ideas take on a life of 
their own. Crazy and fun ideas are “seriously” discussed. The potential problems and possible
solutions incite debates and excitement. But how do you start a collaboration? How do you get 
funding? Is the idea worth investing resources into? These are but a few questions you might ask yourself. <br><br>
  
On the 19th of March, in the midst of the corona-virus lockdown, I sat with Sebastiaan Haffert and 
Robert Harris over Zoom to talk about their collaboration. The design, development and deployment of 
the Multi Core Integral Field Unit. A collection of ideas that took three years to condense into a 
research project. The MCIFU (pronounced em-chifu) is a prototype of a spectrograph that will be used 
to characterize exoplanets. <br><br>

The project has benefited from over 30 co-authors, with a now transnational group including contributions 
  from the UK, Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands and the USA. <br><br></p>


<h2>Back Story</h2>
  
<p>Rob and Sebastiaan (two co-founders of NYRIA) met back in 2014 at the "Reaching the limits of the sky, 
  astronomical instrumentation in the 21st Century" in Chile. It was off the back of this summer 
  school that NYRIA was formed. At the time, Rob was a final year PhD student at Durham University, 
  UK and Sebastiaan was a Masters Student at Leiden University, Netherlands. Since then Rob went on to 
  finish his PhD and is now a post-doc at the MPIA, Germany working on the MICADO instrument for the ELT. 
  Sebastiaan finished his Masters Degree and PhD at Leiden University and took his Sagan fellowship to 
  Steward Observatory, USA to work on the exoplanet imaging instrument MagAO-X. </p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<b>Can you in a few lines describe the project that the two of you are collaborating on?</b> <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> “We are collaborating on a small spectrograph”. <br>
<b>Rob:</b> “To characterise exoplanets”   *rob grins in his characteristically rob grin way* <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> “Yeah [...] what is novel about our new approach is that we use a lot of new photonic 
  technology developed and collaborated from Rob’s side to create a new link between the 
  image plane and the spectrograph [...] for this kind of science you need to have some 
  way to transport the focal plane image to the spectrograph and we developed a new photonic 
  way of doing it by using a special fibre and 3D printed lenses, laser written waveguides, 
  fancy new stuff [...] It’s a novel spectrograph with a novel way of reformatting the 
  image plane into a spectrograph. <br><br>


<b>What gap does this fill in research?</b> <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> the gap it would fill would be higher resolution, so at the moment we mainly have 
low resolution spectra of planets [...]. So some people want to know what kind of molecules are 
present in an atmosphere or what kind of abundance ratio there is, to know that you actually need to 
go to higher resolution, you need to see the molecular lines, you need to be able to resolve those. 
So I think that is a gap that the instrument can fill, where before we only had low resolution spectra
where you can infer temperature and mass while now with higher resolution you can actually do molecular 
characterization. [...] There are three major direct imaging instruments in the infrared which are SCExAO, 
GPI and SPHERE and they have a resolving power of 50 so that means all three can only do temperature 
measurements of the planet and maybe the gravity, and if they are very very lucky there is a broader water 
absorption feature or methane feature but they are very difficult to characterise at that resolving power 
of 50 you really need to go to resolving power of a couple 1000 to be able to do actual atmospheric characterisation. <br><br>

<b>So what is your resolving power?</b> <br>
Seb: the measured resolving power was 3000. The design was to go to 7000 and we are effectively operating at half our resolving power. 

Starting the Collaboration 
<b>So Rob brings in the photonic fibres and your [Seb] side of things is what?</b> <br>
<b>Rob:</b> “Sebastiaan is the brain child, its his baby”<br><br>

<b>So how did you even get to that discussion? </b> <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> I wanted to use single mode fibres because I thought it would be cool. In 2015, just 
in the first or second week of my PhD I went to Durham at that photonics workshop and I saw the single 
mode fibres, and thought it was a cool technology to use. In the couple weeks after the conference, I 
started simulating the single-mode fibers. And then I found that it could actually be interesting to use 
single mode fibres. At that moment we were like okay this is very nice but how do we make an actual single 
mode fibre bundle. [...] It was a pain, there was no company that was able to get the tolerances to what 
we needed. And then Rob showed his 3D printed nano-optics on fibers.<br>
<b>Rob:</b> That was at NYRIA in France. <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> I was like, I need that. <br>
*Both Chuckle* <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> That was also the moment when I started discussing things with Rob, in Paris. <br>
<b>Rob:</b> And it's all kind of spiralled since there because we chatted a lot about it at SPIE and we 
decided we wanted to do it and then a few weeks later I had a report due from OPTICON that I had to work 
with VPH grating people[...], and Sebastiaan had already mentioned he wanted to make a VPH spectrograph 
and so we got in contact with them and they were really keen to do that and there was some time at the 
William Herschel Telescope (WHT) came up in December, so we just thought we would put in an application 
and we got time. Which meant we had to build the spectrograph. <br>
*Both Chuckle* <br>
<b>Sebastiaan:</b> [...] When we got the telescope time awarded, we didn't have anything yet. <br>
<b>Rob:</b> Yeh. Well you had some basic designs [...] there was a lot of panic after that <br>
