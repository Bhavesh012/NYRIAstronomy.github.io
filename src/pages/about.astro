    <p class="text-left">
      NYRIA was built upon the idea of a “<i>Network of Young Researchers in Instrumentation for Astronomy.</i>” 
      This network focuses primarily on ground-based instrumentation in the visible-infrared domain. 
      From 2022, our focus also included space-based instrumentation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text-left">
      The next generation of telescopes and instruments will be built by large international consortia. 
      Therefore, it is essential that the next generation of astronomical instrumentalists get to know 
      each other in preparation for working in these groups. To this end, we aim to make these meetings 
      annual and hope the network of early career researchers grows and strengthens. This will allow us 
      to update our research and findings, exchange ideas and discuss recent developments in everyone’s 
      field. The topics span from hardware and software to topics as diverse as wavefront sensing, 
      coronagraphy, spectroscopy, fiber optics, and post-processing techniques to reach the limit of 
      current and future instruments.

Over the course of two weeks, eighteen students from Europe and Latin America gathered in Santiago, Chile, to learn from experts, socialise and learn about other areas of instrumentation from each other. In addition, they were given a guided tour of the ESO facilities at Paranal Observatory.",
