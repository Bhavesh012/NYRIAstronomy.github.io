<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>This research aims at the dedicated shaping of the stellar PSF in an exoplanet imager to create an image-plane 
  dark area at the position of an exoplanet. In this approach, we do not distinguish between the role of the
  coronagraph and AO. Instead we treat the combined system as an adaptive coronagraph, where the coronagraph 
  imposes a static phase addition on the wavefront, and the AO system imposes dynamic phase additions with 
  closed-loop feedback from the wavefront sensor measurements and periodic updates from the focal plane 
  imaging camera. This direct, nonlinear approach of minimization of stellar light at the exoplanet's position 
  will significantly enhance the achievable contrast of exoplanet imagers by correcting all remaining wavefront 
  aberrations and component imperfections.  </p>
