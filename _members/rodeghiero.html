<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p> The Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) will be the first-light instrument of E-ELT. As post-doc at MPIA, I’m responsible for the design and development of the MICADO calibration unit that will provide the instrument with flat-field, wavelength and astrometric calibration.
 part of the calibration infrastructure, I’m supporting the development of an astrometric error budget that embraces both MICADO and the MCAO module, MAORY, that will assist the instrument during the observations.</p>
