<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>I'm currently finishing my DPhil at the University of Oxford, supervised by Suzanne Aigrain and Pat Roche. I'm interested in computationally-driven approaches to getting the most out of astronomical observations, in particular for finding and characterizing exoplanets. My most recent work has been on observing bright (third magnitude!), saturated stars with Kepler, but I'm also interested in large photometric surveys, precise characterization of stellar properties, and interferometry and coronagraphy. After my DPhil I'll be taking up a Sagan Fellowship at NYU.</p>
