title: Image processing for the detection and characterization of exoplanets in high contrast images

summary: During my PhD I studied two image processing methods whose goal is to extract information about the stellar nearby environments (such as the presence of companions) from high contrast images obtained with ground-based telescopes. The two methods I worked on are based on an inverse problem approach and exploit either the temporal diversity or the spectral diversity given by the instrument used. This kind of method requires an accurate imaging model as well as prior knowledge both on the instrument and on the sought objects. As a postdoc, I’m now carrying on my research on image processing in high dynamics, applied on instruments such as VLT/NaCo and VLT/SPHERE. I’m also working on SCAO simulations for the E-ELT/METIS instrument and I’m part of the GRAVITY GTO team.
