title: Image processing for the detection and characterization of exoplanets in high contrast images

summary: "In the field of exoplanet detection, I am working on image processing techniques to extract exoplanets and disks signals within high contrast images obtained from ground-based telescopes. The methods I am working on are based on an inverse problem approach, which requires an accurate imaging model as well as prior knowledge both on the instrument and on the sought objects. In that framework, I am simulating high-contrast images from instruments such as VLT/NaCo and VLT/SPHERE and I am comparing it to the real data they deliver to study their current limitations. Iâ€™m also involved in the ELT/METIS first light instrument, doing SCAO simulations."
