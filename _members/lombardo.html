<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>Due to the increasing dimension, complexity and cost of the future astronomical surveys, new technologies
enabling more compact and simpler systems are required. The development of curved detectors allows us to enhance 
the performances of the optical system used (telescope or astronomical instrument), while keeping the system more 
compact. This new technology allows one to have a compact and almost refractive elements-free telescope design, that 
is particularly suitable for ultra-low surface brightness (ULSB) observations, and a wide field of view that can 
be used for gravitational wave electro-magnetic counterparts search. </p>

<p>My research focuses on the construction of the compact and almost fully reflective Schmidt telescope (CASTLE) 
aimed at testing the curved detector technologies. This telescope delivers a Point Spread Function (PSF) with 
extremely-compact wings, key factor for the detection of ULSB features in the sky. In order to demonstrate the 
feasibility of this project, I performed end-to-end photon Monte Carlo simulations and I characterized a set of 
prototypes of curved detectors made in collaboration with CEA-LETI.  </p>
