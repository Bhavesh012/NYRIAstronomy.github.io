<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>
The GMT design consists of seven circular 8.4-m diameter segments separated by 30-40 cm 
gaps, creating the possibility of fluctuations in optical path differences between each 
mirror segment due to flexure, wind loading, and temperature effects. In order to 
utilize the full diffraction-limited aperture of the GMT, the seven mirror segments 
must be co-phased to within a fraction of a wavelength. I’m working on the design and 
build of a “GMT High-Contrast Phasing Testbed” which leverages the existing MagAO-X 
ExAO instrument to demonstrate fine phase sensing and simultaneous AO-control for 
high-contrast GMT natural guide star science. The testbed will simulate the GMT 
primary and secondary mirror phasing system and will include a GMT dispersed fringe 
sensor and a pyramid wavefront sensor to measure and correct the phasing of the GMT 
under realistic wind load and seeing conditions.
