<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>I work on the LINC-NIRVANA AO system, which adopts multiple field-of-view, layer-oriented approach to multi-conjugate adaptive optics, using only natural guide stars. We correct the ground layer and a higher layer using two separate pyramid wavefront sensing units. One challenge we face is the partially illuminated pupils or what we call the ‘partial illumination issue’. This is due to the fact that at a higher layer, the footprints of the stars available may not fill the entire field of view projected on the deformable mirror and the wavefront sensor it is conjugated to. We have devised an algorithm that will take care of the issue without wasting sky time. This was tested positive in the lab using simulated stars.</p>

<p>Currently, I work on the ‘wind predictive wavefront control’. In other words, can we make use of the direct atmospheric information of a specific layer available from the layer-oriented multi-conjugated adaptive optics system in real-time to improve the quality of correction and/or to improve the stability of the loop? We believe this is possible. We are currently testing this idea for the lab-data taken from the LINC-NIRVANA instrument. Implementing an algorithm to extract the wind vector from the telemetry data could at least improve the stability of the loop, and possibly the quality of correction.</p>
