<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>I research in the field of adaptive optics. Wavefront sensing and reconstruction, AO calibration, 
  predictive control using AO telemetry are a few topics I enjoy doing research, in addition to the actual 
  hands-on work in optics.<br>
  Projects include: LINC-NIRVANA, INGOT, MAVIS, SHARK-NIR, MAORY.</p>
