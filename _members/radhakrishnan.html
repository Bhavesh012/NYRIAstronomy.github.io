<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>I research in the field of adaptive optics. Wavefront sensing and reconstruction, AO calibration, predictive control using AO telemetry are a few topics I enjoy doing research, in addition to the actual hands-on work in optics.</p>

<p>Currently, I work on the ‘wind predictive wavefront control’. In other words, can we make use of the direct atmospheric information of a specific layer available from the layer-oriented multi-conjugated adaptive optics system in real-time to improve the quality of correction and/or to improve the stability of the loop? We believe this is possible. We are currently testing this idea for the lab-data taken from the LINC-NIRVANA instrument. Implementing an algorithm to extract the wind vector from the telemetry data could at least improve the stability of the loop, and possibly the quality of correction.</p>
