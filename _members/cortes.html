<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>Part of the Instrument System at ESO, working on ERIS and PDS.</p>
<p>Before I worked at MPE, with the "new" second generation instrument for Paranal Observatory, ERIS. Performing the integration, alignment, operation and characterization of the instrument.</p>

<p><b>Prior Research:</b> </p>
<p>Worked on Instrumentation engineer group at Paranal, and at the Science Operation group.</p>
<p>During my PhD I studied a method for turbulence profiling using the information of the 5 WFS laser guide stars of GeMS, at Gemini South. And afterwards I worked as an Instrument engineer at Paranal, for mainly the following instruments: SINFONI, MACAO, SPHERE and NACO.</p>
