<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>
Transit spectroscopy and multi-band photometry has been so far conducted using general-purpose, space-based instruments. 
These measurements however suffer from a high level of systematic error due to issues such as pointing jitter, 
thermal and opto-mechanical stability, wavelength and photometric calibration, and detector stability. Testing and 
calibration of high precision photometers for the detection of planetary transits requires a light source which 
photometric stability must be better than the goal stability of the photometer to be tested. 
</p>
<p>
My project aims to research and develop a device that senses the light source fluctuations and modulates the beam, 
both in flux and in spectra, to produce a sufficiently stable source, a truly impressive challenge when 
stabilization levels of few ppm are required over long periods of observation.
