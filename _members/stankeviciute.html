<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>Recently, Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) (with masses from 100 to 105 Solar Masses) 
attracted wide attention due to importance in understanding how the black holes at various masses are 
formed, in particular the super-massive ones seen in quasars. One of the most novel techniques to detect 
them is to use so called Gravitational Microlensing phenomenon which able to create two separated images 
of the background source. Another method that can confirm possible candidates is Tidal disruption events 
(TDE). When a star and a BHs (Supermassive or Intermediate) meet, the star can be ripped apart by the 
tidal force of the BH and it produces flashes in UV range.</p>

<p>My research work is focused on combining my previous engineering background (improving ground based 
instruments and developing new possible tools (for example: Cube satellites, stratospheric drones and 
balloons)) with Gravitational Microlensing and Tidal Disruption Events to look for possible candidates
of Intermediate Mass Black Holes. </p>
