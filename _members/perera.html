<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>
In interferometry the presence of the turbulent atmosphere induces fluctuations in the optical path difference 
  between each telescope used (baseline). As a result, the observed fringes are unstable, randomly moving around 
  the sidereal position. Therefore, control of the phase aberration caused by the atmosphere i.e. the piston 
  stability, is necessary for interferometry. 
</p>
<p>
Typically, this has been done by employing adaptive optics and fringe trackers to increase the sensitivity of 
  interferometers. The Piston Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx), is a new method that requires only pseudo open 
  loop AO data to reconstruct the temporal piston drift from the atmosphere. This has the advantage that the system 
  can be easily implemented since all required hardware will already be available at the relevant interferometers.  
  Currently, I am working with LBTI and VLTI Gravity data.
