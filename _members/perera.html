position: "PhD Student" 
title: "Optical Turbulence Profiling"

summary: "Currently I am completing my PhD in optical turbulence profiling at the Centre for Advanced Instrumentation, Durham University. With a new generation of ELTs being proposed, optical turbulence characterisation will become even more crucial to understanding observational limitations of any site. My research has been in low-cost portable profilers and seeing monitors to be used at astronomical observing sites. The main instrument I have developed and tested is the SHIMM, a variation on the current DIMM design, that utilizes a low order Shack-Hartmann lenslet array instead of a two-hole aperture mask. In addition, we at Durham have been part of a collaborative effort with ESO and Pontifical Catholic University of Chile to develop the FASS-SHIMM. The FASS is a medium resolution optical turbulence profiler, modified from the MASS technique. "
