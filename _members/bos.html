title: "Towards the characterization of Earth-like exoplanets with LEXI"

summary: "Exoplanet characterization and detection is currently a hot topic. To do this characterization it is necessary to separate the stellar light from planetary light. One way of doing this is high contrast imaging, where the stellar light is suppressed and only the planet light is allowed to reach the detector. Another technique is using the high resolution spectrocopy, where the planetary spectra lines and stellar lines are resolved. This allows you to separate the two based on radial velocity differences. I develop concepts where the two techniques are used together in a single instrument. The high contrast imaging component reduces the influence of the stellar light, and which allows for a better retrieval of the spectral components of the planet through high resolution spectroscopy. This is tested on the LEXI instrument, which is used as a pathfinder for future E-ELT instrument concepts. Most of the current concepts I have developed are based on photonic technology. And one of my personal goals is to add high contrast imaging to the field of astrophotonics."
