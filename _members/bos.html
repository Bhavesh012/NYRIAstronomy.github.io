title: "The vector-APP coronagraph as integral part of a spectropolarimetric high-contrast imaging system"

summary: "Steven Bos is a PhD student working under the supervision of Frans Snik. He is developing the vector Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP) coronagraph into an integral part of a high-contrast imaging system. This means that the vAPP will be designed to be integrated with focal-plane wavefront sensing (fpWFS), polarimetry and spectroscopy by leveraging the unique properties of liquid-crystal technology. This will enable unambiguous characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and surfaces. He is also interested in fpWFS with the vector vortex coronagraph, the rigorous modelling of optical systems and star, disk and planet formation."
