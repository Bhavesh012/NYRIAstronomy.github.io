position: "PhD Student" 
title: "Mechanical Design of a Large Image De-rotator for an Infrared Camera« within the international MICADO consortium"

summary: "MICADO in the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO), which is being designed to work with adaptive optics at the E-ELT. My PhD thesis will focus on developing MICADO's de-rotator, a key mechanical component that must carry the cryostat (3 tons) and the wavefront sensor while connecting them to the support structure and at the same time, must stably de-rotate the whole instrument around its vertical axis of symmetry."
