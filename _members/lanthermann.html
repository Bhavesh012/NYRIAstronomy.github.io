<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>Astronomical interferometry is reaching a limit with current detector technology, as CMOS technology can't reach lower noise. That's why for my PhD I'm working on a new technology, the Avalanche PhotoDiode (APD) that can increase the sensibility and lower the noise increasing the income flux thanks to an tunnel effect assisting avalanche process, directly in the detector. To demonstrate the performance of the new instrument, I will study massive binaries, in which a gap currently exists between the direct imaging (long separation) and spectral study (really short separation), that the interferometry can fill, thanks to the improvement of the sensibility bring by the APD.</p>
<p>My work will be to characterise the new technology detector, and optimise its use to obtain the best performance from it.
The detector I work with is located in the CHARA array (USA), and is used for the actual MIRC improvement (MIRCX) and the up-coming instrument MYSTIC.</p>
<p>I also worked on the analysis of the first data of GRAVITY (VLTI), and especially on the Fringe Tracker data, which use the same technology (APD).</p>
