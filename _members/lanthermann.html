<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>
CLASSIC++/CLIMB++ consists in the upgrade of the existing CLASSIC/CLIMB beam combiner 
  situated at the CHARA array. It will use the e-APD detector technology to focus the 
  improvement in sensitivity of the instrument, by upgrading also its optical design 
  to adapt to the new camera and improve even more the performances.
