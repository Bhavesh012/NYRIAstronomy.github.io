title: "Development of next generation vector vortex coronagraphs"

summary: "The direct detection of exoplanets requires the use of dedicated, high contrast imaging instruments. In this context, vector vortex coronagraphs (VVC) are considered as one of the most promising solutions to reach high contrast at small angular separations. My research project, included in the Vortex project (Ulg), aims to improve the design and performance of VVC based on sub wavelength gratings, etched into synthetic diamond, by integrating the device with pupil apodizers (Ring Apodized Vortex Coronagraph) and optimized Lyot stops, in order to compensate for central obstruction and spiders effect. These different coronagraphic solutions are included in an end-to-end performance simulation, that takes into account the major source of errors in modern telescope (the adaptive optics residuals, wind-induced pointing jitter, non-common path aberrations, etc) to define the final performance of the instrument for high-contrast imaging."
