<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>
Direct measurement and spectroscopy of exoplanets is extremely difficult because of the 
contrast and tiny angular separation to the star. The techniques like coronagraphy and 
nulling interferometry that avoid the limitation of the photon noise from the star, end 
up being vulnerable to the tiniest instrumental optical path differences. <br>
Through my work in kernel phases and kernel-nulling interferometry, I'm trying to 
develop techniques, both in signal processing and in optics, to provide more robust 
observables that are both more accurate and more reliable. This would make a much 
larger sample of planets accessible to direct characterization.
