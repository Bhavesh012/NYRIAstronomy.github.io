affiliation: "INAF-Padova"
country: "Italy" 
position: "Post-Doctoral Researcher"
title: "Instrumentation for high angular resolution astronomy"

summary: "I work in the field of Astrophotonics. This field aims to make use emerging technologies developed for the telecommunications industry within astronomy. During my PhD I created reformatting devices using Ultrafast Laser Inscription and custom fibres in collaboration with Heriot-Watt and Bath Universities. Since then I have branched out to include 3D printing of optics, with Karlsruhe Institute for Technology. Currently I am working with PhD students on wavefront sensing, vibration correction and improving coupling efficiency and stability of instruments"
