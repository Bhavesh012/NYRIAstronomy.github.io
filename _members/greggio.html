<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>As post-doc at the University of Padova, I am responsible for the optical design and performance characterization of both ground and space-based instrumentation. I am currently involved in the following projects: </p>
<p>· JANUS: the visible camera of the JUICE (Jupiter ICy moons Explorer) satellite, the large mission of ESA dedicated to the study of the Jovian system. </p>
<p>· SHARK-NIR: the 2nd generation instrument for the Large Binocular Telescope dedicated to high contrast imaging. </p>
<p>· PLATO: the medium-class mission of ESA whose objective is to find and study a large number of extrasolar planetary down to earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. </p>
