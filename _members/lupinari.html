<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p> G-CLEF is a state of the art echelle spectrograph for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT).  
Its good performance for seeing limited observations, expected for first light,  may be further 
improved with the future use of an extreme Adaptive Optics (AO) system to cancel out atmospheric 
disturbances and optimize throughput.  The goal of our project is to perform laboratory optical-bench 
experiments to simulate G-CLEF working with and without AO. We measure the efficiency of the G-CLEF 
fiber in both cases to compute the gain in using an AO system.</p>
