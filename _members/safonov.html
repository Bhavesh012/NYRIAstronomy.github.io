<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p> Nowadays differential polarimetry is actively used to improve the contrast 
provided by a coronagraph at the distance from the bright source several 
times larger than the Airy disk size. However, apart from that, 
differential polarimetry have great potential for study of spatial 
structures at the distance from the star comparable and smaller than the 
Airy disk size. The corresponding method is so called polarimetric 
interferometry.<br>

Our understanding of bright inner parts of circumstellar environment of 
young stars and evolved stars would benefit greatly from polarimetric 
interferometry. In the future, it may also be useful for studying active 
galactic nuclei and supernovae. Generally speaking, in all cases when 
polarigenic mechanism is not entirely clear, the localization of source of 
polarized light at the highest possible angular resolution may be the key. <br>

For the development of high angular resolution polarimetry I with my 
colleagues at SAI MSU designed and constructed a specialized instrument: 
speckle polarimeter. It is a combination of a two-beam polarimeter with 
rotating half-wave plate and a EMCCD-based speckle interferometer. Speckle 
polarimeter is used for regular observations at 2.5 m telescope of SAI 
MSU. <br>

The basic observable which is measured with this instrument is the ratio 
of visibilities in orthogonally polarized light. This quantity can be 
measured with much greater accuracy than the visibility itself thanks to 
differential polarimetric approach. Using speckle polarimeter even at the 
telescope of modest size and without AO we managed to obtain some 
interesting results: 1) Discovery of a nebula at 0.15" to the south of 
mu Cep. 2) Tracing the protoplanetary disk (or probably a disk wind?) of 
RY Tau down to distances of 0.05" from the star. 3) Discovery of mysterious 
variable nebula around V CVn. More to come.
