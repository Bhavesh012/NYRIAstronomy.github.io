<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>
The measurement of the refractive index of solid samples has been implemented for many years, however with the 
continuous development of new types of materials and new possible applications, some techniques are no longer as 
viable or efficient. Existing techniques for determining the refractive index that produce results with a high 
accuracy, in the order of 10-5, involve the construction of optical prisms with very tight manufacturing tolerances
and are associated to very high manufacturing costs. The challenge proposed for this master thesis is the development
of a cost-effective, simple to implement and automated system capable of producing reliable results with an uncertainty 
below 10-2, on optically simple samples. A HeNe laser, a precision stage and a CCD camera are used, the latter two 
controlled by LabVIEW code. <br>

Data collected by the lateral displacement of the laser in the CCD allowed the achievement of measurements of the 
refractive index of glass samples (around 10 mm thick) with an uncertainty of 10<sup>-3</sup> and an error typically of 
10<sup>-3</sup>, lower for calibration samples (10<sup>-4</sup>)
