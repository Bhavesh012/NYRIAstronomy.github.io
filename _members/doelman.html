summary: "Exoplanet characterization and detection is currently a hot topic. To do this characterization it is necessary to separate the stellar light from planetary light. One way of doing this is high contrast imaging, where the stellar light is suppressed and only the planet light is allowed to reach the detector. Another technique is using the high resolution spectrocopy, where the planetary spectra lines and stellar lines are resolved. This allows you to separate the two based on radial velocity differences. I develop concepts where the two techniques are used together in a single instrument. The high contrast imaging component reduces the influence of the stellar light, and which allows for a better retrieval of the spectral components of the planet through high resolution spectroscopy. This is tested on the LEXI instrument, which is used as a pathfinder for future E-ELT instrument concepts. Most of the current concepts I have developed are based on photonic technology. And one of my personal goals is to add high contrast imaging to the field of astrophotonics."

<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>With liquid-crystal technology it is possible to make arbitrarily-patterned diffractive phase plates that 
apply achromatic phase. In my work I look for uses of this technology to improve high-contrast imaging systems.</p>

<p>My main topic is the vector-Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP) coronagraph, a single-optic pupil plane coronagraph. 
The achromatic properties of the liquid-crystal optics can be used to make broadband vAPP coronagraphs with up to 
100% bandwidth. I designed and helped commission many vAPPs for the largest telescopes around the world (LBT, Magellan, 
Subaru, VLT, and ELT).  I also work on improving the vector-vortex coronagraph to make it suitable for future space 
missions like HabEx.</p>
<p>In addition, I worked on wavefront sensing for non-common path aberrations. I upgraded the Zernike wavefront 
sensor to be able to measure phase and amplitude aberrations simultaneously. Furthermore, I designed vAPP coronagraphs
to have additional holographic probes in the focal plane for wavefront sensing.</p>
<p>Lastly, I worked on improving sparse aperture masking by using holographic techniques to increase the throughput, 
number of baselines and number of closure phases. I designed a new mask, a holographic aperture mask (HAM), that is 
installed on Keck in OSIRIS.</p>
